# Hello, I'm Mocha! 👋

I'm a 20-year-old furry & gunzel from Victoria, passionate about exploring Melbourne's Public Transport. Here are a couple of projects I'm currently working on:

- [mochara.cc](https://mochara.cc) - My main website where you can find all my socials (like Twitter, YouTube), think of it as a Linktree or Carrd
- [ptft.info](https://ptft.info) - My fictional Transport Fever 2 operator, yes, everything is fictional.
